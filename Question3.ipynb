Introduction\\nHow could the DeepSeek-V3 model achieve incredible performance and economical training as an open source model? In this paper review, we will explore the various features that were invented and applied to build the DeepSeek-V3 model. The way the paper presents the model may seem complicated to people who are unfamiliar with the new conceptualization invented by DeepSeek. However, its core principle still resembles that of the standard Transformer and well-known LLMs. It will be incredibly helpful to have general knowledge of previously released large language models like LLaMA. I will also add my own interpretation of the DeekSeek model in this story.\\nLet’s dive into the new features of model architecture step by step.\\n2. Model Architecture\\nFirst of all, we will investigate the core architecture of DeekSeek-V3 model. The DeekSeek-V3 model has inherited most parts of model from previous V2 model. These parts of model were elaborated more in V2 paper, but it is worth noting the principle how V3 model was built upon. While they used the structure of the ordinary transformer block like Llama, its attention and Feed-Forward Network were more sophisticated to boost the model performance. The overview of the Transformer block is as shown in the following diagram.\\nThe two main components are Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) and DeepSeekMoE.\\n- 2.1 Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)\\nWhat is Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)? You might noticed that “Latent” is only additional word to conventional attention module. MLA improved the speed and memory usage in the attention block by compressing the input vector. From a data analysis perspective, the data can be compressed into a lower dimension while preserving the information it contains. One of the well-known techniques is Principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimension of the data and maintains variance to retain its information. In latent diffusion model, the input data is compressed by variational autoencoder and reconstructed in initial dimension. The Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA) applied this principle to compress and decompress the input data. By storing a compressed vector for the KV cache, the DeepSeek model can improve both speed by reducing data copying and memory efficiency by using a smaller compressed vector. The weight matrix for compression is additionally required, because human cannot compress it manually, but AI should learn it how the compression should be done. Applying RoPE to the compressed vector is not mathematically compatible, which was shown in detail in V2 paper, they used decoupled RoPE. As illustrated in the figure above, RoPE is applied to query and key, but also the query and key without RoPE. The RoPE-applied query and key are then concatenated with their respective non-RoPE counterparts. Finally, the query and key are obtained as normal transformer block, then the computation of dot-product attention will not be different from original one. But we could reach this point with a more economical KV cache thanks to the lower dimension of data.\\n- 2.2 DeekSeekMoE\\nSecondly, you can note that Feed-Forward Network is unusual as it was split into a lot of experts, rather than one large FFN. They called it as DeekSeekMoE. Like humans in a group, the AI also needs to specialized in certain domain to improve the performance. Thus, the mixture of experts come into play here. Each expert can specialize in certain domain, in this case, the group of tokens that they are familiar with, instead of coping with entire range of tokens alone. Dependent on the input sequence(tokens), the certain experts are selected to be activated and they contribute to make output. Shared experts are generalist and are activated for all kind of tokens. Then it might be interesting to know by what algorithm we can select the experts? We need to assign a vector to each expert which determines the range of tokens(domain) that experts can deal with well. And we give score to each expert to check how similar the domain of expert and input token are. If the score is high, then we should select the expert and let them activated to make output. Well, it sounds quite simple. Let’s see the math behind it.\\neᵢ is a centroid vector. It is learned during training and represents the type of input tokens the expert specialized in. Each expert’s centroid vector encodes the knowledge domain it specializes in.\\nuₜ is input vector to FFN. The dot product uₜᵀ eᵢ quantifies the similarity between the input vector uₜ\\u200b and the centroid (or domain) of expert eᵢ, effectively measuring the alignment of the input data with the expert’s specialized domain. So, the sᵢ = Sigmoid(uₜᵀ eᵢ) represents the score for each i-th expert, determining whether the expert should be selected. By gating value gᵢ, which select Kᵣ experts with high score by Topk algorithm. We add all outputs of selected experts and shared experts, then we arrive to the final output.\\n2.3 Multi-Token Prediction\\nIn a standard transformer, the model generates a token each time, and this new token is fed back into decoder as input. Since this way restricts the efficiency and the speed of convergence during training, many researchers have made effort to come up with a method to generate multiple tokens each time. DeepSeek improved the conventional way of Multi-Token Prediction(MTP). Instead of previous parallel MTP, DeepSeek decided sequential MTP. They construct independent MTP modules, where the previous output of the Transformer block is concatenated into the subsequent MTP module, as illustrated in the following figure.\\nAs shown in the figure, the structure of MTP modules is akin to RNN model. But, unlike RNN, which preserve hidden states of nodes, the MTP modules send output of prediction to the subsequent module. Even though a single Transformer block cannot generate multiple tokens, the entire system of MTP modules collectively enables multi-token prediction. As it compares additional tokens per prediction, it provides more information for weight updates during training, leading to more efficient learning and faster convergence. The model can proactively learn and prepare for the additional tokens.\\nIn actual training, DeepSeek opted to generate only one additional token, presumably due to the computational cost which is caused by using many MTP modules. It necessitate the compromise between the benefits of MTP and computational cost. During inference, the MTP modules are discarded, generating only one token per prediction.\\n3. Infrastructure\\n3.1 DualPipe\\nSince the U.S. did not export great GPUs like the NVIDIA H100 to China, DeepSeek researchers had to devise innovative methods to accelerate model training using the weaker H800 GPUs. Since they succeeded, NVIDIA’s stock price briefly plunged, as people believed that high-performance GPUs would no longer be necessary for training LLM. Because the DeepSeek model was trained on 2048 H800 GPUs, communication between GPUs accounts for large portion of training time. Therefore, enhanching networking between GPUs has to play crucial role to reduce training time. When we use many GPUs simultaneously, the GPUs have to wait for a certain amount of time until new data is copied from other GPU. This waiting time, which causes training inefficiencies, is known as a “bubble,” and we should minimize it as much as possible. DeepSeek invented a innovative method to reduce bubble.\\nDuring model training, data flows through the model in forward and backward processes. In forward process, data goes from the input layer to the output layer. On the other hand, during the backward process data moves from the output layer to the input later, updating weights based on the information to minimize the loss. Prior to DeepSeek, researchers found that the backward process can be split into two processes, which are backward for input and backward for weight, in order to remove more bubbles. The backward for input is computation of the gradient of the loss with respect to the input data, whereas the backward for weight calculates gradient of the loss with respect to the weight. The backward for input must be completed ahead of the backward for weight, because it is necessary to compute the backward for weight. Mathematically, the chain rule is applied to the calculation of backpropagation, where the backward for input is used for the calculation of backward for weight.\\nIn such process, it is certain that an enormous number of communications between GPUs is required. In order to reduce the number of communication, the DeepSeek’s DualPipe combines the forward process and the backward for input by initiating training data from two devices in the opposite directions as illustrated in following figure.\\n\\nThe batch 0 is the initial data, which starts processing on the device 0 and continues on the subsequent devices. In a conventional training plan, the device 7 remains idle, waiting for the batch 0 to be copied onto it. However, DualPipe makes the device 7 start training with other batch data in the opposite direction. This allows us to combine them as a chunk and continuously copy them together on other devices to reduce communication between GPUs. With weaker H800 GPUs, they couldn’t improve the speed of the GPUs, but reduce the communication between GPUs to accelerate the training.\\n\\n3.2 Mixed precision training\\nMixed precision training is already prevalent technique of LLM to improve training and memory efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy. In mixed precision training, it is critical task to find out which parts of model are less significant for the model accuracy and reduce the precision that parts. In DeepSeek-V3 model, the researchers have found that they should reduce precision in the parts of model where heavy computations are executed, such as matrix multiplication. In contrast, they preserved high precision for matrix addition and storing data, which are relatively lightweight computation. The mixed precision training of DeepSeek is shown in the following figure.\\n\\nWhile reducing the precision by the method above, overflow and underflow arise as a impediment. If the numerical values are quantized in lower precision like FP8 format, the values are clipped to the certain representable range. While computation in lower precision, the values can easily exceed the range during the computation. Scaling the values can mitigate the overflow and underflow by adjusting the values and lead to more proper representation in limited range. But, static scaling, which applies fixed scaling factor to all values, can still cause overflow and underflow for many values. To cope with this issue, DeepSeek implemented Fine-Grained Quantization. In this method, the values are grouped, and each group has its own scaling factor. This approach allows the each group of values to have a more suitable scaling factor, by which the overflow and underflow can be averted.\\nAnother issue of quantization is that the small errors can be accumulated and become more serious problem later. In order to avoid that a lot of values with error are summed and their errors are accumulated, intermediate values are copied in high precision, if the number of values reaches the interval. It means that some values are grouped, and their values are stored in high precision. Then, the errors of values aren’t accumulated on a large scale, because the small group of values don’t contribute to large error.\\nThese two techniques to prevent quantization error are visualized in following figure.\\n\\n4. Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek additionally implemented reinforcement learning. A reward model has to be built and trained for reinforcement learning, which gives feedback to the model and determine the direction of learning. The rule-based reward model(RM) and model-based reward model(RM) were employed.\\nThe rule-based RM is applied to the questions with specific rules, such as math problems and LeetCode problems. In these domains, the specific rules are used to verify the correctness of the answers and the questions about logical reasoning are involved. However, for many questions, the answer cannot be verified by a specific rule. In those cases where no rule is provided, the model-based RM determines, whether the answer matches the ground-truth answer. Another innovative idea of DeepSeek is including the chain-of-thought to the reward, whereas conventional models only included final reward based on the answer.\\nDeepSeek-V3 model, as V2 model did, adopted Group Relative POlicy Optimization (GRPO). This GRPO algorithm maximizes the following objective by updating the policy model π.\\n\\nMaximize this objective by updating the weights of the model based on the reward.\\n\\nAdvantage is defined as the normalized reward.\\nIn LLM case, the policy model π is model itself, and θ is weights of the model. q is question and o is output of the model. We can interpret the policy model(LLM) outputs a probability distribution over tokens, where the policy π(o|q) is a probability of output o given the question q. Therefore, the policy model is LLM itself. If the output o is right answer, we should reinforce the probability of that model makes this output o. So we need to maximize π(o|q) by multiplying advantage(normalized reward). If the output o is correct, the advantage (reward) will be a positive value and the policy will be reinforced. Otherwise, it will be negative and π(o|q) should be minimized. Plus, we have a fine-tuned model as the initial base model and do not want it to go too far from this base model, which might cause model to forget basic language understanding and important knowledge that the model learned during pre-training and fine-tuning. To implement this safety concerns, GRPO algorithm used KL divergence and epsilon parameter. The KL divergence measures the difference between current policy model and reference policy model(initial base model). So the KL divergence term should be minimized to maximized the GRPO objective. And we pick minimum between the original policy and the clipped policy in (1-ε, 1+ε), by which the model cannot deviate too much from 1. So, the current policy cannot differ a lot from the old policy, restricting the effect of reinforcement learning. This GRPO algorithm based on rule-based and model-based reward model enhances model performance and reasoning capability.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\nDeepSeek-V3 model offered great opportunity for efficient training with cheaper GPUs. It is unclear that its performance exceeds the OpenAI model, but DeepSeek is way more economical to train and open-source model. AI researchers can directly use DeekSeek models and they can also implement the innovative ideas and designs in their own model, because the new methods of DeepSeek and source code are opened. Seemingly, the DeepSeek researchers have potential to come up with more advanced idea to improve the model performance and efficient training process. In AI development, a lower training cost almost always implies better model accuracy later on, as the data and model can easily be scaled up at a lower cost. I hope that the performance of a good AI model does not have to be undermined by the censorship and suppression of the Chinese government.'}, {'question': 'Design Notes\\n\\n#', 'answer': 'Design and implementation\\n\\nThe 3FS system has four components: cluster manager, metadata service, storage service and client.

CRAQ’s write-all-read-any approach helps to unleash the throughput of SSDs and RDMA network. A 3FS file is split into equally sized chunks, which are replicated over multiple SSDs.\\n\\nTwo clients are developed for applications: FUSE client and native client. Most applications use FUSE client, which has a low adoption barrier. Performance-critical applications are integrated with the native client.\\n\\n#'}, {'question': 'File system interfaces\\n\\nObject store is becoming a popular option for data analytics and machine learning. However, file system semantics and a unified namespace where files are organized in directories provide greater flexibility for applications.\\n\\n-   *Atomic directory manipulation* An object store can approximate hierarchical directory structures by using slashes (/) in object keys. However, it doesn’t natively support operations like atomically moving files/directories, or recursively deleting entire directories. Actually a common pattern in our internal applications involves creating a temporary directory, writing files to it, and then moving the directory to its final location. When handling a large number of small files, the recursive delete for directories is crucial. Without it, applications have to traverse each directory and remove files one by one.\\n\\n-   *Symbolic and hard links* Our applications utilize symbolic and hard links to create lightweight snapshots of dynamically updated datasets, where new data is appended as individual files.\\n\\n-   *Familiar interface* The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API. Many datasets are stored as CSV/Parquet files. Adapting file-based data loaders to use the 3FS FUSE client or native client is straightforward.\\n\\n##', 'answer': 'Limitations of FUSE\\n\\nFUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) simplifies file system client development by redirecting I/O operations to user-space processes through the FUSE kernel module. It creates the illusion that applications are accessing the remote file system as if it were a local file system. However, it has performance limitations:\\n\\n-   *Memory copy overhead* The user-space file system daemon cannot access application memory. Data transfer between kernel and user spaces consumes memory bandwidth and increases end-to-end latency.\\n\\n-   *Primitive multi-threading support* When an application initiates I/O requests, FUSE places these requests into a multi-threaded shared queue, protected by a spin lock. The user-space file system daemon then retrieves and processes requests from this queue. Due to lock contention, FUSE’s I/O processing capability fails to scale with the number of threads. Our benchmark results indicate that FUSE only handles approximately 400K 4KiB reads per second. Further increasing concurrency does not improve performance as lock contention intensifies. `perf` profiling reveals that the kernel-space spin lock consumes a significant amount of CPU time.\\n\\nMost applications, e.g. data analytics, perform large block writes on 3FS or they can buffer data in memory and flush it to 3FS when write buffer is full. However, FUSE on Linux 5.x does not support concurrent writes to the same file[^1]. Applications overcome this limitation by writing to multiple files concurrently, maximizing the total throughput.\\n\\nRead operations exhibit more complex patterns. Some training jobs require random access to dataset samples, with read sizes varying from a few kilobytes to several megabytes per sample. And samples are typically not 4K-aligned in files. Data loaders are specifically designed to fetch batches of samples. But they perform poorly when handling small random reads on FUSE-mounted 3FS. Bandwidth of SSDs and RDMA network are not fully utilized.\\n\\n##'}, {'question': 'Asynchronous zero-copy API\\n\\nImplementing the file system client as a VFS kernel module avoids performance issues mentioned above. But kernel module development is significantly more challenging than user-space system programming. Bugs are difficult to diagnose and can lead to catastrophic failures in production environments. For example, machines may crash and leave no log message for debugging. When upgrading a kernel module, all processes using the file system must be stopped cleanly; otherwise, a machine restart is required.\\n\\nFor these reasons, we have chosen to implement a native client within the FUSE daemon. This client offers an interface that supports asynchronous zero-copy I/O operations. File meta operations are still handled by FUSE daemon (e.g. open/close/stat files). Applications call `open()` to obtain a file descriptor (fd) and register it via native API. They can then perform I/O operations on the file with native client. This approach ensures consistency in metadata operations with the POSIX API, making it easier to migrate existing code.\\n\\nThe asynchronous, zero-copy API is inspired by Linux `io_uring`. Below are the key data structures in the API:\\n\\n-   *Iov* A large memory region for zero-copy read/write operations, shared between the user process and the native client. InfiniBand memory registration is managed by the client. In native API, all read data will be read into Iov, and all write data should be written to Iov before calling the API.\\n\\n-   *Ior* A small shared ring buffer for communication between user process and native client. The usage of Ior is similar to Linux `io_uring`, where the user process enqueues read/write requests, and the native client dequeues these requests for completion. The requests are executed in batches, with their sizes controlled by the `io_depth` parameter. Multiple batches are processed in parallel, whether from different rings or the same ring. However, multiple rings are still recommended for multi-threaded applications, as sharing a ring requires synchronization, which can impact performance.\\n\\nWithin the native client, multiple threads are spawned to fetch I/O requests from the Iors. These requests are batched and dispatched to storage services, reducing RPC overhead caused by small read requests.\\n\\n#', 'answer': 'File metadata store\\n\\n##'}, {'question': 'Location of file chunks\\n\\n3FS divides file data into equally sized chunks and stripes them across multiple replication chains (replication chains and chain tables are defined in Section [Data placement](#data-placement)). Users can specify the chain table, chunk size, and stripe size for files on a per-directory basis. Each chunk is independently stored on multiple storage services, with its chunk ID generated by concatenating the file’s inode id and chunk index.\\n\\nWhen creating a new file, the metadata service employs a round-robin strategy to select consecutive replication chains from the designated chain table, based on the stripe size. Next, a random seed is generated to shuffle the selected chains. This allocation strategy ensures balanced data distribution across chains and SSDs.\\n\\nWhen an application opens a file, the client contacts the meta service to obtain the file’s data layout information. Then the client can independently compute chunk IDs and chains for data operations, minimizing the involvement of the meta service in the critical path.\\n\\n##', 'answer': 'File metadata on transactional key-value store\\n\\n3FS uses FoundationDB as its distributed storage system for metadata. FoundationDB provides a key-value store interface and supports transactions with Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI). 3FS stores all metadata as key-value pairs in FoundationDB. Meta services follow a stateless architecture, greatly enhancing maintainability by allowing administrators to seamlessly upgrade or restart services without disruption. When clients experience request failures or timeouts, they can automatically fail over to other available services.\\n\\nThe file system metadata primarily consists of two core structures: inodes and directory entries. Inodes store attribute information for files, directories, and symbolic links, each identified by a globally unique 64-bit identifier that increments monotonically. Inode keys are constructed by concatenating the \"INOD\" prefix with the inode id, which is encoded in little-endian byte order to spread inodes over multiple FoundationDB nodes. The inode values vary by its type:\\n\\n-   All inode types contain basic attributes: ownership, permissions, access/modification/change times.\\n\\n-   Additional attributes for file inodes: file length, chunk size, selected range in chain table, shuffle seed.\\n\\n-   Additional attributes for directory inodes: the parent directory’s inode id, default layout configurations for subdirectories/files (chain table, chunk size, stripe size). The parent’s inode id is required to detect loops when moving directories. When moving `dir_a/dir_b` to `dir_c/`, we need to ensure that `dir_c` is not a descendant of `dir_b`, which can be achieved by checking all ancestors of `dir_c` upward.\\n\\n-   Additional attributes for symbolic link inodes: target path string.\\n\\nDirectory entry keys are composed of a \"DENT\" prefix, the parent inode ID, and the entry name. Directory entry values store the target inode id and inode type. All entries within a directory naturally form a contiguous key range, allowing efficient directory listing via range queries.\\n\\nThe meta operations leverage FoundationDB’s transactions:\\n\\n-   Read-only transactions used for metadata queries: fstat, lookup, listdir etc.\\n\\n-   Read-write transactions used for metadata updates: create, link, unlink, rename etc.\\n\\nFor write transactions, FoundationDB tracks the read/write key sets to form conflict detection sets. When concurrent transaction conflicts are detected, the meta service automatically retries the transaction. This design enables multiple meta services to process requests in parallel while maintaining file system metadata consistency.\\n\\n##'}, {'question': 'Dynamic file attributes\\n\\nOn most local file systems, deleting an opened file is deferred until all associated file descriptors are closed. Consequently, it is necessary to track all file descriptors of the file. Training jobs open a large number of files during startup. Storing all file descriptors would impose heavy load on meta service and FoundationDB. Since training jobs do not depend on this feature, 3FS does not track file descriptors opened in read-only mode.\\n\\n3FS maintains a file session for each file descriptor (fd) opened in write mode since deleting write opened files may lead to unreclaimable garbage chunks from concurrent writes. When a file with active write sessions is deleted, meta service delays the deletion until all its fds are closed. To prevent lingering sessions from offline clients, the 3FS meta service periodically checks client liveness and cleans up sessions of offline clients.\\n\\nThe file length is stored in the inode. For files being actively updated, the length stored in inode may diverge from the actual length. Clients periodically (5 seconds by default) report to meta service maximum write position of each file opened in write mode. If this position exceeds the length in inode and there is no concurrent truncate operation, this position is adopted as the new file length.\\n\\nDue to the possibility of concurrent writes from multiple clients, the method described above ensures only eventual consistency for file lengths. When processing close/fsync operations, the meta service obtains the precise file length by querying the ID and length of the last chunk from the storage service. Since file data is striped across multiple chains, this operation incurs non-negligible overhead.\\n\\nConcurrent updates to the same file’s length by multiple meta services may cause transaction conflicts and lead to repeated file length computation. To mitigate this, meta service distributes file length update tasks across multiple meta services using inode IDs and the rendezvous hash algorithm.\\n\\nOur production environments use a large stripe size: 200. For small files, the number of chains containing file chunks is well below this number. The number of potentially used chains is stored in file inode and used as a hint when updating the length. It starts with an initial value of 16 and is doubled each time additional file chunks are written to more chains. This allows us to avoid querying all 200 chains when updating lengths of small files. This optimization can also be extended to the deletion of small files.\\n\\n#', 'answer': 'Chunk storage system\\n\\nThe design goal of chunk storage system is to achieve the highest bandwidth possible even when there are storage medium failures. The read/write throughput of 3FS should scale linearly with the number of SSDs and bisection network bandwidth between clients and storage services. Applications access storage services in a locality-oblivious manner.\\n\\n##'}, {'question': 'Data placement\\n\\nEach file chunk is replicated over a chain of storage targets using chain replication with apportioned queries (CRAQ). In CRAQ write requests are sent to the head target and propagated along a chain. Read requests can be sent to any of the storage target. Usually the read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain for better load balance. Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD and the targets join different chains.\\n\\nSuppose there are 6 nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F. Each node has 1 SSD. Create 5 storage targets on each SSD: 1, 2, ... 5. Then there are 30 targets in total: A1, A2, A3, ..., F5. If each chunk has 3 replicas, a chain table is constructed as follows.\\n\\n| Chain | Version | Target 1 (head) | Target 2 | Target 3 (tail) |\\n| :---: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-------------: |\\n|   1   |    1    |      `A1`       |   `B1`   |      `C1`       |\\n|   2   |    1    |      `D1`       |   `E1`   |      `F1`       |\\n|   3   |    1    |      `A2`       |   `B2`   |      `C2`       |\\n|   4   |    1    |      `D2`       |   `E2`   |      `F2`       |\\n|   5   |    1    |      `A3`       |   `B3`   |      `C3`       |\\n|   6   |    1    |      `D3`       |   `E3`   |      `F3`       |\\n|   7   |    1    |      `A4`       |   `B4`   |      `C4`       |\\n|   8   |    1    |      `D4`       |   `E4`   |      `F4`       |\\n|   9   |    1    |      `A5`       |   `B5`   |      `C5`       |\\n|  10   |    1    |      `D5`       |   `E5`   |      `F5`       |\\n\\nEach chain has a version number. The version number is incremented if the chain is changed (e.g. a storage target is offline). Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables.\\n\\nA few chain tables can be constructed to support different data placement requirements. For example, two chain tables can be created, one for batch/offline jobs and another for online services. The two tables consist of storage targets on mutually exclusive nodes and SSDs.\\n\\nLogically, the state of each chain changes independently. Each chain can be included in multiple chain tables. The concept of chain table is created to let metadata service pick a table for each file and stripe file chunks across chains in the table.\\n\\n##', 'answer': 'Balanced traffic during recovery\\n\\nSuppose read traffic is evenly distributed among all storage targets in the above chain table. When A fails its read requests would be redirected to B and C. Under heavy load the read bandwidth of B, C is immediately saturated and B, C become the bottleneck of the entire system. Replacing a failed SSD and syncing data to the new SSD can take several hours. The read throughput is impaired during this period.\\n\\nTo reduce the performance impact, we can have more SSDs share the redirected traffic.

Utilizing read bandwidth of all replicas is critical to achieve highest read throughput in an all-flash storage system.\\n\\nWhen a write request is received by a storage service, it goes through the following steps:\\n\\n1.  The service checks if the chain version in write request matches with the latest known version; reject the request if it’s not. The write request could be sent by a client or a predecessor in the chain.\\n\\n2.  The service issues RDMA Read operations to pull write data. If the client/predecessor fails, the RDMA Read operations may time out and the write is aborted.\\n\\n3.  Once the write data is fetched into local memory buffer, a lock for the chunk to be updated is acquired from a lock manager. Concurrent writes to the same chunk are blocked. All writes are serialized at the head target.\\n\\n4.  The service reads the committed version of the chunk into memory, applies the update, and stores the updated chunk as a pending version. A storage target may store two versions of a chunk: a committed version and a pending version. Each version has a monotonically-increasing version number. The version numbers of committed version and pending versions are `v` and `u` respectively, and satisfy `u = v + 1`.\\n\\n5.  If the service is the tail, the committed version is atomically replaced by the pending version and an acknowledgment message is sent to the predecessor. Otherwise, the write request is forwarded to the successor. When the committed version is updated, the current chain version is stored as a field in the chunk metadata.\\n\\n6.  When an acknowledgment message arrives at a storage service, the service replaces the committed version with the pending version and continues to propagate the message to its predecessor. The local chunk lock is then released.\\n\\nSuppose there are 3 targets in the chain: `A, B, C`. A write request has just entered step 5 at `A`. `A` forwards the request to successor `B`. Then `B` instantly fails and the forwarded write request is lost. When cluster manager detects `B`’s failure, it marks `B` as offline and moves it to the end of chain and broadcasts the updated chain table. Once `A` receives the latest chain table, it forwards the write request to the new successor `C`. `C` may not receive the latest chain table yet and rejects the request. But `A` can keep forwarding the request to `C`. Eventually `C` gets the latest chain table and accepts the request.\\n\\nWhen a read request arrives at a storage service:\\n\\n1.  When the service only has a committed version of the chunk, this version is returned to the client.\\n\\n2.  Unlike CRAQ, our implementation does not issue version query to the tail target. When there are both committed and pending versions, the service replies a special status code to notify the client. The client may wait for a short interval and retry. Or the client can issue a relaxed read request to get the pending version.\\n\\n##', 'answer': 'Failure detection\\n\\nThe cluster manager relies on heartbeats to detect fail-stop failures. Cluster manager declares a service failed if it does not receive heartbeats from it for a configurable interval (e.g. T seconds). A service stops processing requests and exits if it cannot communicate with cluster manager for T/2 seconds. The heartbeat can be seen as a request to \\\\*renew a lease\\\\* granted by the manager.\\n\\nThe metadata services are stateless. The list of online meta services provided by cluster manager is a simple service discovery mechanism that helps clients create connections to metadata services. If one meta service is down, the clients may switch to any other metadata service.\\n\\nCluster manager plays a more critical role in membership changes of storage services. It maintains a global view of chain tables and storage targets’ states.

When all required chunks have been transferred, a sync-done message is sent to the successor.\\n\\nThe rules used to decide which chunks should be transferred are:\\n\\n-   If a chunk only exists on the local target, it should be transferred.\\n\\n-   If a chunk only exists on the remote target, it should be removed.\\n\\n-   If the chain version of local chunk replica is greater than that of the remote chunk replica, it should be transferred.\\n\\n-   If the chain versions of local/remote chunk replicas are the same but local committed version number does not equal to the remote pending version number, it should be transferred.\\n\\n-   Otherwise, two chunk replicas are either the same or being updated by in-progress write requests.\\n\\n##', 'answer': \"Chunks and the metadata\\n\\nFile chunks are stored in the chunk engine. On each SSD, the persistent storage of the chunk engine consists of a fixed number of data files for storing chunk data, and a RocksDB instance for maintaining chunk metadata and other system information. Additionally, the chunk engine maintains an in-memory cache of chunk metadata to enhance query performance. A chunk allocator is implemented for fast allocation of new chunks. The chunk engine interface provides thread-safe access through the following operations:\\n\\n1.  *open/close* Initializes the engine by loading metadata from RocksDB and reconstructing chunk allocator states.\\n\\n2.  *get* Retrieves chunk metadata and reference-counted handle through a hashmap cache, enabling concurrent access with O(1) average complexity.\\n\\n3.  *update* Implements copy-on-write (COW) semantics by allocating new chunks before modifying data. Old chunks remain readable until all handles are released.\\n\\n4.  *commit* Commit the updated chunk metadata to RocksDB via write batches to ensure atomic updates; synchronously refresh the chunk metadata cache.\\n\\nThe chunk data will ultimately be stored on physical blocks. Physical block sizes range from 64KiB to 64MiB in increments of powers of two, totaling 11 distinct sizes. The allocator will assign physical blocks whose sizes most closely match the actual chunk size. A resource pool is constructed for each physical block size, with each pool containing 256 physical files. The usage status of physical blocks is maintained in memory using bitmaps. When a physical block is reclaimed, its bitmap flag is set to 0. The actual storage space of the block remains preserved and will be prioritized for subsequent allocations. When no available physical blocks remain, `fallocate()` will be used to allocate a contiguous large space in physical files, creating 256 new physical blocks - this approach helps reduce disk fragmentation.\\n\\nWhen performing write operations on a chunk, the allocator first assigns a new physical block. The system then reads existing chunk data into a buffer, applies the update, and writes the updated buffer to the newly allocated block. An optimized process is implemented for appends, where data is directly added in-place at the end of the existing block. A new copy of metadata is constructed from the new block's location and existing chunk metadata. Subsequently, both the new chunk metadata and statuses of new and old physical blocks are atomically updated in RocksDB.\\n\\n[^1]: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.284/source/fs/fuse/file.c#L1573\"}, {'question': \"202502 Open-Source Week\\n\\nWe're a tiny team @deepseek-ai pushing our limits in AGI exploration.\\n\\nStarting this week , Feb 24, 2025 we'll open-source 5 repos – one daily drop – not because we've made grand claims, but simply as developers sharing our small-but-sincere progress with full transparency.\\n\\nThese are humble building blocks of our online service: documented, deployed and battle-tested in production.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\\nperformance comparable to OpenAI’s o1 series models.\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n31.1. Contributions\\nPost-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n• We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as\\na preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for\\nsolving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating\\nlong CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the\\nfirst open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized\\npurely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future\\nadvancements in this area.\\n• We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL\\nstages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human pref-\\nerences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model’s reasoning and\\nnon-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating\\nbetter models.\\nDistillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\\n• We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller\\nmodels, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered\\nthrough RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit\\nthe research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\\n• Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models\\nthat are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that\\nthe distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. DeepSeek-\\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves 55.5% on AIME 2024, surpassing QwQ-32B-Preview. Addi-\\ntionally, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B scores 72.6% on AIME 2024, 94.3% on MATH-500,\\nand 57.2% on LiveCodeBench. These results significantly outperform previous open-\\nsource models and are comparable to o1-mini. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B,\\n32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.\\n1.2. Summary of Evaluation Results\\n• Reasoning tasks: (1) DeepSeek-R1 achieves a score of 79.8% Pass@1 on AIME 2024, slightly\\nsurpassing OpenAI-o1-1217. On MATH-500, it attains an impressive score of 97.3%,\\nperforming on par with OpenAI-o1-1217 and significantly outperforming other models. (2)\\nOn coding-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates expert level in code competition tasks,\\nas it achieves 2,029 Elo rating on Codeforces outperforming 96.3% human participants in\\nthe competition. For engineering-related tasks, DeepSeek-R1 performs slightly better than\\nDeepSeek-V3, which could help developers in real world tasks.\\n• Knowledge: On benchmarks such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA Diamond, DeepSeek-\\nR1 achieves outstanding results, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-V3 with scores\\nof 90.8% on MMLU, 84.0% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA Diamond. While its\\nperformance is slightly below that of OpenAI-o1-1217 on these benchmarks, DeepSeek-R1\\nsurpasses other closed-source models, demonstrating its competitive edge in educational\\ntasks. On the factual benchmark SimpleQA, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms DeepSeek-V3,\\ndemonstrating its capability in handling fact-based queries. A similar trend is observed\\nwhere OpenAI-o1 surpasses 4o on this benchmark.\\n4• Others: DeepSeek-R1 also excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing,\\ngeneral question answering, editing, summarization, and more. It achieves an impressive\\nlength-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on Are-\\nnaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries.\\nAdditionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring\\nlong-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context\\nbenchmarks.\\n2. Approach\\n2.1. Overview\\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model\\nperformance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly\\nimproved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with\\nthe inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1)\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and\\n(2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of\\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to\\nsmall dense models.\\n2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data,\\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\\nGroup Relative Policy OptimizationIn order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\\nSpecifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, ··· , 𝑜𝐺}from the old\\npolicy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:\\nJ𝐺𝑅𝑃𝑂 (𝜃)= E[𝑞∼𝑃(𝑄), {𝑜𝑖}𝐺\\n𝑖=1 ∼𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑂|𝑞)]\\n1\\n𝐺\\n𝐺∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n\\x12\\nmin\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)𝐴𝑖, clip\\n\\x12 𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞), 1−𝜀, 1+𝜀\\n\\x13\\n𝐴𝑖\\n\\x13\\n−𝛽D𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01\\x13\\n, (1)\\nD𝐾𝐿\\n\\x00\\n𝜋𝜃||𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓\\n\\x01 =\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −log\\n𝜋𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑜𝑖|𝑞)\\n𝜋𝜃(𝑜𝑖|𝑞) −1, (2)\\nwhere 𝜀 and 𝛽 are hyper-parameters, and 𝐴𝑖 is the advantage, computed using a group of\\nrewards {𝑟1, 𝑟2, ... , 𝑟𝐺}corresponding to the outputs within each group:\\n𝐴𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖 −m𝑒𝑎𝑛({𝑟1, 𝑟2, ··· , 𝑟𝐺})\\ns𝑡𝑑({𝑟1, 𝑟2, ··· , 𝑟𝐺}) . (3)\\n5A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.\\nThe assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user\\nwith the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and\\n<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>\\n<answer> answer here </answer>. User: prompt. Assistant:\\nTable 1 |Template for DeepSeek-R1-Zero. prompt will be replaced with the specific reasoning\\nquestion during training.\\n2.2.2. Reward Modeling\\nThe reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL.\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two\\ntypes of rewards:\\n• Accuracy rewards: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct.\\nFor example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required\\nto provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable\\nrule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be\\nused to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\\n• Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward\\nmodel that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘<think>’ and ‘</think>’\\ntags.\\nWe do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero,\\nbecause we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale\\nreinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training\\nresources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\\n2.2.3. Training Template\\nTo train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we begin by designing a straightforward template that guides\\nthe base model to adhere to our specified instructions. As depicted in Table 1, this template\\nrequires DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer.\\nWe intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific\\nbiases—such as mandating reflective reasoning or promoting particular problem-solving strate-\\ngies—to ensure that we can accurately observe the model’s natural progression during the RL\\nprocess.\\n2.2.4. Performance, Self-evolution Process and Aha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\\nPerformance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Figure 2 depicts the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero on the AIME 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process. As illustrated,\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates a steady and consistent enhancement in performance as the\\nRL training advances. Notably, the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a significant\\nincrease, jumping from an initial 15.6% to an impressive 71.0%, reaching performance levels\\ncomparable to OpenAI-o1-0912. This significant improvement highlights the efficacy of our RL\\nalgorithm in optimizing the model’s performance over time.\\nTable 2 provides a comparative analysis between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI’s o1-0912\\nmodels across a variety of reasoning-related benchmarks. The findings reveal that RL empowers\\n6Model AIME 2024 MATH-500 GPQA LiveCode CodeForcesDiamond Bench\\npass@1 cons@64 pass@1 pass@1 pass@1 rating\\nOpenAI-o1-mini 63.6 80.0 90.0 60.0 53.8 1820\\nOpenAI-o1-0912 74.4 83.3 94.8 77.3 63.4 1843\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero 71.0 86.7 95.9 73.3 50.0 1444\\nTable 2 |Comparison of DeepSeek-R1-Zero and OpenAI o1 models on reasoning-related\\nbenchmarks.\\nFigure 2 |AIME accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Zero during training. For each question, we sample\\n16 responses and calculate the overall average accuracy to ensure a stable evaluation.\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised\\nfine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model’s ability to\\nlearn and generalize effectively through RL alone. Additionally, the performance of DeepSeek-\\nR1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting. For example,\\nwhen majority voting is employed on the AIME benchmark, DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s performance\\nescalates from 71.0% to 86.7%, thereby exceeding the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. The\\nability of DeepSeek-R1-Zero to achieve such competitive performance, both with and without\\nmajority voting, highlights its strong foundational capabilities and its potential for further\\nadvancements in reasoning tasks.\\nSelf-evolution Process of DeepSeek-R1-ZeroThe self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero\\nis a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities\\nautonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, we can closely monitor the model’s\\nprogression without the influence of the supervised fine-tuning stage. This approach provides\\na clear view of how the model evolves over time, particularly in terms of its ability to handle\\ncomplex reasoning tasks.\\nAs depicted in Figure 3, the thinking time of DeepSeek-R1-Zero shows consistent improve-\\n7Figure 3 |The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL\\nprocess. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time.\\nment throughout the training process. This improvement is not the result of external adjustments\\nbut rather an intrinsic development within the model. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the\\nability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time compu-\\ntation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens,\\nallowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.\\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of this self-evolution is the emergence of sophisticated\\nbehaviors as the test-time computation increases. Behaviors such as reflection—where the model\\nrevisits and reevaluates its previous steps—and the exploration of alternative approaches to\\nproblem-solving arise spontaneously. These behaviors are not explicitly programmed but instead\\nemerge as a result of the model’s interaction with the reinforcement learning environment. This\\nspontaneous development significantly enhances DeepSeek-R1-Zero’s reasoning capabilities,\\nenabling it to tackle more challenging tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy.\\nAha Moment of DeepSeek-R1-ZeroA particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during\\nthe training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as\\nillustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase,\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial\\napproach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities\\nbut also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and\\nsophisticated outcomes.\\nThis moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers\\nobserving its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather\\nthan explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the\\nright incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The\\n“aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of\\nintelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in\\nthe future.\\n8Question: If 𝑎 >1, then the sum of the real solutions of\\n√︁\\n𝑎−√\\n𝑎+𝑥 = 𝑥 is equal to\\nResponse: <think>\\nTo solve the equation\\n√︁\\n𝑎−√\\n𝑎+𝑥 = 𝑥, let’s start by squaring both ···\\x10√︁\\n𝑎−√\\n𝑎+𝑥\\n\\x112\\n= 𝑥2 =⇒ 𝑎−√\\n𝑎+𝑥 = 𝑥2.\\nRearrange to isolate the inner square root term:\\n(𝑎−𝑥2)2 = 𝑎+𝑥 =⇒ 𝑎2 −2𝑎𝑥2 +(𝑥2)2 = 𝑎+𝑥 =⇒ 𝑥4 −2𝑎𝑥2 −𝑥+(𝑎2 −𝑎)= 0\\n. . .\\nWait, wait.

The\\nmodel learns to rethink using an anthropomorphic tone. This is also an aha moment for us,\\nallowing us to witness the power and beauty of reinforcement learning.\\nDrawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning\\ncapabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces\\nseveral issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,\\nand language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the\\nopen community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly\\ncold-start data.\\n2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start\\nInspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can\\nreasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small\\namount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that\\nnot only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong\\ngeneral capabilities? To address these questions, we design a pipeline to train DeepSeek-R1. The\\npipeline consists of four stages, outlined as follows.\\n2.3.1. Cold Start\\nUnlike DeepSeek-R1-Zero, to prevent the early unstable cold start phase of RL training from\\nthe base model, for DeepSeek-R1 we construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data\\nto fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor. To collect such data, we have explored several\\napproaches: using few-shot prompting with a long CoT as an example, directly prompting\\nmodels to generate detailed answers with reflection and verification, gathering DeepSeek-R1-\\nZero outputs in a readable format, and refining the results through post-processing by human\\nannotators.\\nIn this work, we collect thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as\\nthe starting point for RL. Compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero, the advantages of cold start data\\n9include:\\n• Readability: A key limitation of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is that its content is often not suitable\\nfor reading. Responses may mix multiple languages or lack markdown formatting to\\nhighlight answers for users. In contrast, when creating cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1,\\nwe design a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response and\\nfilters out responses that are not reader-friendly. Here, we define the output format as\\n|special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|<summary>, where the reasoning\\nprocess is the CoT for the query, and the summary is used to summarize the reasoning\\nresults.\\n• Potential: By carefully designing the pattern for cold-start data with human priors, we\\nobserve better performance against DeepSeek-R1-Zero. We believe the iterative training is\\na better way for reasoning models.\\n2.3.2. Reasoning-oriented Reinforcement Learning\\nAfter fine-tuning DeepSeek-V3-Base on the cold start data, we apply the same large-scale\\nreinforcement learning training process as employed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. This phase focuses\\non enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks such\\nas coding, mathematics, science, and logic reasoning, which involve well-defined problems with\\nclear solutions. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing,\\nparticularly when RL prompts involve multiple languages. To mitigate the issue of language\\nmixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated\\nas the proportion of target language words in the CoT. Although ablation experiments show\\nthat such alignment results in a slight degradation in the model’s performance, this reward\\naligns with human preferences, making it more readable. Finally, we combine the accuracy of\\nreasoning tasks and the reward for language consistency by directly summing them to form the\\nfinal reward. We then apply RL training on the fine-tuned model until it achieves convergence\\non reasoning tasks.\\n2.3.3. Rejection Sampling and Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nWhen reasoning-oriented RL converges, we utilize the resulting checkpoint to collect SFT\\n(Supervised Fine-Tuning) data for the subsequent round. Unlike the initial cold-start data, which\\nprimarily focuses on reasoning, this stage incorporates data from other domains to enhance the\\nmodel’s capabilities in writing, role-playing, and other general-purpose tasks. Specifically, we\\ngenerate the data and fine-tune the model as described below.\\nReasoning data We curate reasoning prompts and generate reasoning trajectories by perform-\\ning rejection sampling from the checkpoint from the above RL training. In the previous stage,\\nwe only included data that could be evaluated using rule-based rewards. However, in this stage,\\nwe expand the dataset by incorporating additional data, some of which use a generative reward\\nmodel by feeding the ground-truth and model predictions into DeepSeek-V3 for judgment.\\nAdditionally, because the model output is sometimes chaotic and difficult to read, we have\\nfiltered out chain-of-thought with mixed languages, long parapraphs, and code blocks. For\\neach prompt, we sample multiple responses and retain only the correct ones. In total, we collect\\nabout 600k reasoning related training samples.\\n10Non-Reasoning data For non-reasoning data, such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition,\\nand translation, we adopt the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and reuse portions of the SFT dataset of\\nDeepSeek-V3. For certain non-reasoning tasks, we call DeepSeek-V3 to generate a potential\\nchain-of-thought before answering the question by prompting. However, for simpler queries,\\nsuch as “hello” we do not provide a CoT in response. In the end, we collected a total of\\napproximately 200k training samples that are unrelated to reasoning.\\nWe fine-tune DeepSeek-V3-Base for two epochs using the above curated dataset of about\\n800k samples.\\n2.3.4. Reinforcement Learning for all Scenarios\\nTo further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary reinforcement\\nlearning stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while simultane-\\nously refining its reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we train the model using a combination\\nof reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we adhere to the\\nmethodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which utilizes rule-based rewards to guide the\\nlearning process in math, code, and logical reasoning domains. For general data, we resort to\\nreward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build\\nupon the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and adopt a similar distribution of preference pairs and train-\\ning prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the\\nassessment emphasizes the utility and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing\\ninterference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire\\nresponse of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and\\nmitigate any potential risks, biases, or harmful content that may arise during the generation\\nprocess. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals and diverse data distributions enables us\\nto train a model that excels in reasoning while prioritizing helpfulness and harmlessness.\\n2.4. Distillation: Empower Small Models with Reasoning Capability\\nTo equip more efficient smaller models with reasoning capabilities like DeepSeek-R1, we directly\\nfine-tuned open-source models like Qwen (Qwen, 2024b) and Llama (AI@Meta, 2024) using\\nthe 800k samples curated with DeepSeek-R1, as detailed in §2.3.3. Our findings indicate that\\nthis straightforward distillation method significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of smaller\\nmodels. The base models we use here are Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-\\n14B, Qwen2.5-32B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We select Llama-3.3 because its\\nreasoning capability is slightly better than that of Llama-3.1.\\nFor distilled models, we apply only SFT and do not include an RL stage, even though\\nincorporating RL could substantially boost model performance. Our primary goal here is to\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the distillation technique, leaving the exploration of the RL\\nstage to the broader research community.\\n3. Experiment\\nBenchmarks We evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), MMLU-Redux (Gema\\net al., 2024), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and CMMLU (Li et al.,\\n2023), IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023), FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2024), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al.,\\n2023), SimpleQA (OpenAI, 2024c), C-SimpleQA (He et al., 2024), SWE-Bench Verified (OpenAI,\\n112024d), Aider 1, LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024) (2024-08 – 2025-01), Codeforces 2, Chinese\\nNational High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024)3, and American Invitational Math-\\nematics Examination 2024 (AIME 2024) (MAA, 2024). In addition to standard benchmarks, we\\nalso evaluate our models on open-ended generation tasks using LLMs as judges. Specifically, we\\nadhere to the original configurations of AlpacaEval 2.0 (Dubois et al., 2024) and Arena-Hard (Li\\net al., 2024), which leverage GPT-4-Turbo-1106 as judges for pairwise comparisons. Here, we\\nonly feed the final summary to evaluation to avoid the length bias. For distilled models, we\\nreport representative results on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA Diamond, Codeforces, and\\nLiveCodeBench.\\nEvaluation Prompts Following the setup in DeepSeek-V3, standard benchmarks such as\\nMMLU, DROP , GPQA Diamond, and SimpleQA are evaluated using prompts from the simple-\\nevals framework. For MMLU-Redux, we adopt the Zero-Eval prompt format (Lin, 2024) in a\\nzero-shot setting. In terms of MMLU-Pro, C-Eval and CLUE-WSC, since the original prompts\\nare few-shot, we slightly modify the prompt to the zero-shot setting. The CoT in few-shot\\nmay hurt the performance of DeepSeek-R1. Other datasets follow their original evaluation\\nprotocols with default prompts provided by their creators. For code and math benchmarks, the\\nHumanEval-Mul dataset covers eight mainstream programming languages (Python, Java, C++,\\nC#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP , and Bash). Model performance on LiveCodeBench is evaluated\\nusing CoT format, with data collected between August 2024 and January 2025. The Codeforces\\ndataset is evaluated using problems from 10 Div.2 contests along with expert-crafted test cases,\\nafter which the expected ratings and percentages of competitors are calculated. SWE-Bench\\nverified results are obtained via the agentless framework (Xia et al., 2024). AIDER-related\\nbenchmarks are measured using a \"diff\" format. DeepSeek-R1 outputs are capped at a maximum\\nof 32,768 tokens for each benchmark.\\nBaselines We conduct comprehensive evaluations against several strong baselines, including\\nDeepSeek-V3, Claude-Sonnet-3.5-1022, GPT-4o-0513, OpenAI-o1-mini, and OpenAI-o1-1217.\\nSince accessing the OpenAI-o1-1217 API is challenging in mainland China, we report its perfor-\\nmance based on official reports. For distilled models, we also compare the open-source model\\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a).\\nEvaluation Setup We set the maximum generation length to 32,768 tokens for the models.\\nWe found that using greedy decoding to evaluate long-output reasoning models results in\\nhigher repetition rates and significant variability across different checkpoints. Therefore, we\\ndefault to pass@𝑘evaluation (Chen et al., 2021) and report pass@1 using a non-zero temperature.\\nSpecifically, we use a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top- 𝑝 value of 0.95 to generate 𝑘\\nresponses (typically between 4 and 64, depending on the test set size) for each question. Pass@1\\nis then calculated as\\npass@1 = 1\\n𝑘\\n𝑘∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑝𝑖,\\nwhere 𝑝𝑖 denotes the correctness of the 𝑖-th response. This method provides more reliable\\nperformance estimates. For AIME 2024, we also report consensus (majority vote) results (Wang\\net al., 2022) using 64 samples, denoted as cons@64.\\n1https://aider.chat\\n2https://codeforces.com\\n3https://www.cms.org.cn/Home/comp/comp/cid/12.html\\n123.1.
